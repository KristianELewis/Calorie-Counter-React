# Calorie-Counter-React
Vite/React server for the front end of my Calorie Counter Project

TODO list



-Switch Login and Sign up components over to the newer error handling

-Switch to using redux for much of the state management

-Think about moving away from Material UI, and using custom made components

-Add an actual styling engine

-Refactor a lot of reused code, make dedicated components

-serverFunctions should be split up into multiple files. Also no reason to be a jsx file
